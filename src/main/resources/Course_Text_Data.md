-  What to Learn:   
  - Setting up monitoring systems  
  - Log aggregation and visualization  
  - Real-time performance tracking  

 

   6. Source Code Management (SCM) (Week 4)   
Source Code Management is the backbone of DevOps workflows. Understanding version control ensures collaboration and consistent code management.  

-  Tool to Learn:  Git & GitHub  
-  Topics to Focus On:   
  - Branching, merging, and pull requests  
  - Managing repositories  
  - Resolving merge conflicts  

 

   Prerequisites for DevOps 

Before diving into core DevOps, it’s important to build a foundation:  

1.  Programming Knowledge (Week 1):  Choose a language like Python or GoLang. Focus on basics such as data types, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming.
